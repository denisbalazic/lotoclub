# Lotoclub

Goal of this app is to help group of Eurojackpot players organize their play.
Users can register, add and update their combinations for next draw, checkout other users' combinations, see some statistics from previous draws (like frequency of a number or number's last draw). Admin of a group can define deadline for submiting combinations and number of played combinations for each draw. There will be automated number picking alghoritam to increase chances of scoring.
